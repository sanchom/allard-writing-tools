# Statement of Facts

◊ The Appellant, Cathie Gauthier, was convicted after trial by jury of
three counts of first degree murder. Her appeal to the Québec Court of
Appeal was dismissed, as was her appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada. The Appellant appeals from that decision to this Court.

◊ On the evening of December 31, 2008, the Appellant's spouse, Marc
Laliberté, served poisoned drinks to himself, the Appellant, and the
couple's three children. The Appellant alone survived, and was
convicted of three counts of first degree murder.

[@gauthier-ca, paras. 5-6]

◊ **The prosecution theory** was that the Appellant had participated in
the offence by planning a murder-suicide pact with her spouse, by
purchasing prescription medication four days before her husband
ultimately put them in the drinks that killed the children, and by
omitting to intervene when her spouse served those drinks. The Crown
led evidence of a pact between the Appellant and her spouse through
documents: a joint will, her spouse's "life story", and several
letters.

# Argument

## Overview

◊ This appeal raises the question of whether a woman who withdraws
from a murder-suicide pact with her spouse and believes that he has
also withdrawn should nonetheless be convicted of murder when he
carries through with the offence on his own.  The Appellant's primary
position is that the Supreme Court of Canada erred in reformulating
the defence of abandonment so as to require that a party take
reasonable steps to neutralize previous assistance or to prevent the
commission of the offence.  However, even if this court accepts this
new element, it should not be applied retrospectively to the
Appellant.

## Argument

## The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada erred in adding a new element to the defence of abandonment

### Party liability

### The defense of abandonment until this case
