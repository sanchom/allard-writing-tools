The leading case in B.C. on the general test for the existence of a
partnership is that of @hayes. In determining whether a partnership
has formed, the meaning of the words "carrying on business in common
with a view of profit" should be considered (@hayes).

The parties must intend a partnership to form (@sproule). The analysis
used to discern the intention of the parties is two-pronged. A court
will first review the agreement between the parties, then will look to
the conduct of the parties (@sproule). Because there is no express
contract in the present circumstances, a court would immediately turn
to the second branch of the analysis, which was described in @hayes as follows:

> [It] requires the court to enquire into whether the conduct of the
  parties during the currency of their joint project constituted a
  partnership relationship notwithstanding their contrary intention
  and the provisions of their agreement (at 123).

The parties in @hayes did not meet the "business in common with a view
to profit" test.
