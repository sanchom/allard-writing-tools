# A heading

¶ In addition to the requirement of an "actionable wrong" independent
of the breach sued upon, punitive damages will only be awarded "where
the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed
that it offends the court's sense of decency" [@hill, para. 196]. Such
behaviour has included defamation [@hill], failing to provide medical
care [@robitaille], and exceptionally abusive behaviour by an
insurance company [@whiten]. Here's another citation to _Robitaille_
with a pinpoint (the first didn't have one) [@robitaille, para. 23].

¶ Since the primary vehicle of punishment is the criminal law,
punitive damages should be scarcely used [@whiten, para. 69]. It is
also important to underline that there cannot be joint and several
responsibility for punitive damages because they arise from the
misconduct of the particular defendant against whom they are awarded.

[@hill, para. 195]

# Single-use citations

## Never used elsewhere

There is no need to report a short-form when a citation is never used
elsewhere.

[@jordan]

## Use within the text is considered a use elsewhere

But, if the citation is used even inline within the paragraph, [@marakah] the
short form is necessary in the paragraph note.

# Another heading

## A subheading
¶ Here, I cite to several pinpoints inline. Those pinpoints should be
collected and then reported together in the paragraph notes
below. Here's the first pinpoint [@hill, para. 5]. Here's the second
pinpoint [@hill, para. 20]. Here's the final pinpoint [@hill,
para. 80].

## Another subheading
¶ I should also be able to cite books [@haack-defending-science,
pp. 32-34]. Paragraph notes must appear in the order that their
citations appeared inline in the paragraph. [@whiten] [@robitaille] [@hill]
