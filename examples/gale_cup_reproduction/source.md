# Statement of Facts

◊ The Appellant, Cathie Gauthier, was convicted after trial by jury of
three counts of first degree murder. Her appeal to the Québec Court of
Appeal was dismissed, as was her appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada. The Appellant appeals from that decision to this Court.

[@gauthier-scc]
[@gauthier-ca]

◊ On the evening of December 31, 2008, the Appellant's spouse, Marc
Laliberté, served poisoned drinks to himself, the Appellant, and the
couple's three children. The Appellant alone survived, and was
convicted of three counts of first degree murder.

[@gauthier-scc, para. 2]
[@gauthier-ca, paras. 5-6]

◊ **The prosecution theory** was that the Appellant had participated in
the offence by planning a murder-suicide pact with her spouse, by
purchasing prescription medication four days before her husband
ultimately put them in the drinks that killed the children, and by
omitting to intervene when her spouse served those drinks. The Crown
led evidence of a pact between the Appellant and her spouse through
documents: a joint will, her spouse's "life story", and several
letters.

[@gauthier-scc, paras. 18, 14]
[@gauthier-ca, para. 41]

◊ The defence theory was that the Appellant had not purchased the
medication for the purpose of poisoning her children. On the day of
the offence, she wrote the documents in a dissociative state, taking
dictation from her spouse. She testified that after her spouse left
the house, she read the documents referencing the pact, which she did
not recall having written, and realized what her spouse intended to
do. Upon his return that afternoon, she told him that the plan was
"crazy", that they could not do it, and that she would not be a part
of it. She further demonstrated her disapproval by ripping up two of
the documents related to the plan. The Appellant testified that she
understood from her spouse's facial expression that he had abandoned
the plan.

[@gauthier-ca, paras. 32, 42-43]
[@gauthier-scc, paras. 12-14, 17, 57]

◊ The Appellant testified that that evening, her spouse served drinks
to their family. She had no idea that the drinks were
poisoned. Shortly after noticing that one of the boys had fallen
asleep, she became unconscious. She later awoke with her wrist slit
and called emergency services. Traces of Oxazepam were detected in the
Appellant, and the evidence was consistent with the finding that her
spouse had slit her wrist.

[@gauthier-scc, paras. 13, 15-16]
[@gauthier-ca, paras. 39-40]

◊ The trial judge did not put the defence of abandonment to the jury
on the basis that it was not available to an individual who aided the
principal offender under section 21(1)(b) of the _Criminal Code_. The
Québec Court of Appeal upheld the Appellant’s conviction, finding that
the defence of abandonment should not have been put to the jury
because it was incompatible with the defence’s primary theory, that
she was in a dissociative state.

[@criminal-code, sec. 21(1)]
[@gauthier-scc, paras. 19-20]
[@gauthier-ca, paras. 49, 71]

◊ A majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, in reasons written by
Wagner J. (Fish J dissenting), also dismissed the appeal. The Court
held that incompatible defences can be put to a jury as long as each
defence has an air of reality to it. In considering the defence of
abandonment, the Court added a new element to the defence that
requires an accused to take reasonable steps to neutralize the effects
of her participation or to prevent the offence. The majority found
that there was no air of reality to this new version of the defence
and denied the Appellant a new trial. Justice Fish, in dissent,
disagreed with the addition of the new element and found that the
trial judge had erred in declining to instruct the jury on the defence
of abandonment. He would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new
trial.

[@gauthier-scc, paras. 64-65, 106-117]

# Argument

## Overview

◊ This appeal raises the question of whether a woman who withdraws
from a murder-suicide pact with her spouse and believes that he has
also withdrawn should nonetheless be convicted of murder when he
carries through with the offence on his own.  The Appellant's primary
position is that the Supreme Court of Canada erred in reformulating
the defence of abandonment so as to require that a party take
reasonable steps to neutralize previous assistance or to prevent the
commission of the offence.  However, even if this court accepts this
new element, it should not be applied retrospectively to the
Appellant.

## Argument

◊ It is well settled that the interpretation of a defence and whether
there is an air of reality to support it being considered by a jury
are both questions of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness. In
concluding that the defence of abandonment lacked an air of reality
and refusing to grant the appellant a new trial, the majority of the
Supreme Court of Canada erred in three respects:

I.  by adding a new element to the defence of abandonment;

II.  by retrospectively applying the new defence to the facts of this
case without giving the appellant a chance to address the new
requirement; and

III.  by incorrectly applying the air of reality test to both the old
and new elements of the defence.

## The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada erred in adding a new element to the defence of abandonment

◊ Prior to the present case, the defence of abandonment required a
party to have a change of intention and to communicate her withdrawal
in a timely and unequivocal manner. The majority of the Court below
added an element that requires an individual to take reasonable steps
to neutralize previous assistance or to prevent the offence. This
element exceeds the purpose of the defence of abandonment and could
lead to the conviction of individuals for offences of which they are
not sufficiently culpable. The Appellant’s case demonstrates this
danger, and requires this Court to consider whether it is justifiable
to convict someone of murder when that person has communicated her
withdrawal, and in this case understood that the offence was not going
to happen.

[@gauthier-scc, para. 78]

◊ The test for abandonment as formulated by the majority makes
neutralizing steps a separate element, yet also recognizes that it
should not always be a requirement. The majority held that such steps
may not be required in situations where the element is met by timely
and unequivocal notice of withdrawal. This is uncertain. Surely a
common law defence should provide certainty to govern people’s
conduct.

[@gauthier-scc, para. 51]

◊ For both these reasons, reasonable neutralizing steps should only be
an evidentiary factor that a jury should consider, along with all the
other evidence, in determining whether the accused actually did change
her intention and communicate her withdrawal in a timely and
unequivocal manner. These are the only essential elements of the
defence.

◊ To understand the problems created by the new requirement to take
reasonable neutralizing steps, it is necessary to consider the nature
of party liability and the crucial role that the defence of
abandonment plays in relation to it.

### Party liability

◊ Section 21(1) of the _Criminal Code_ provides that every one is a
party to an offence who (a) actually commits it; (b) does or omits to
do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or (c)
abets any person in committing it. This case does not raise the issue
of party liability under section 21(2) (which deals offences committed
pursuant to a common unlawful purpose). A party who aids or abets an
offence is generally guilty of the same offence as the principal—the
person who actually commits the offence. The difference between aiding
and personally committing an offence becomes legally irrelevant.

[@criminal-code, sec. 21(1)]
[@thatcher, para. 80]

◊ To be convicted as an aider or abettor, the accused must not only
assist the principal, but must also intend to assist the
principal. Therefore, providing material aid to another person---for
instance, supplying a weapon that is subsequently used in an
offence---will not in itself lead to criminal liability as a
party. The aid must be provided for the purpose of aiding the
principal's subsequent offence. Support and knowledge of the
principal's intent is essential to the crime of aiding and abetting.

[@morgan, para. 17]
[@rose, p. 12]

◊ An accused cannot be convicted of aiding or abetting unless an
offence is actually committed. Aiding is not in itself an offence. A
party’s liability for acts of assistance does not crystallize until
the offence has been committed. Until that time, a party is free to
abandon her participation in the offence.

[@stuart, p. 66]
[@manson, p. 106]

### The defense of abandonment until this case

◊ The defence of abandonment provides the avenue by which a party to
an offence can change her intention and withdraw her participation
without criminal liability, even if others continue and complete the
offence. The defence is an important means of reducing crime by
encouraging those involved in criminal activity to desist, leaving
only the morally culpable to be punished. The premise upon which the
defence of abandonment is based is that a party who has assisted the
principal now tells him: "Let it be known, if you go then you go
alone."

[@gauthier-scc, para. 40]
[@manson, p. 101]

◊ The method of abandonment, accepted in Canada for over 70 years
since _R v Whitehouse_, is a change of intention and timely and
unequivocal notice of withdrawal. That is, the accused must clearly
communicate to the principal "that if he proceeds upon it he does so
without the _further_ aid and assistance of those who withdraw."
(emphasis added) This passage makes clear that the defence of
abandonment is designed to sever criminal liability despite prior
assistance, as long as withdrawal occurs while there is still time for
the principal to avoid the offence as well. If this is done, the
party’s prior assistance becomes legally irrelevant.

[@whitehouse, p. 425]
[@gauthier-scc, para. 78]
[@henderson]
[@kirkness]
[@miller]
[@bird-scc]

### The majority made a substantive change to the defence of abandonment that is contrary to its purpose

◊ In addition to the original requirements of change of intention and
timely and unequivocal communication, the majority of the Court below
added a new element to the defence of abandonment:

> (4) that the accused took, in a manner proportional to his or her
participation in the commission of the planned offence, reasonable
steps in the circumstances either to neutralize or otherwise cancel
out the effects of his or her participation or to prevent the
commission of the offence.

[@gauthier-scc, para. 50]

◊ This is a significant substantive change to the defence. The
analysis in Canadian cases until now has turned on whether there was
timely and unequivocal communication of abandonment:

* {@bird-ca}, rev'd in {@bird-scc} --- The
Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the dissent of Costigan JA, who held
that a female accused who had helped lure the victim and her friend to
a golf course, where the victim was sexually assaulted and killed, did
not meet the requirements for abandonment. Her communication to the
principal that she was taking the victim's friend to the car because
she "doesn't need to see this" was insufficient evidence of either a
change of intention or timely and unequivocal communication.

* {@ball} --- In a case involving two accused in a
joint assault, Ryan JA ruled that abandonment was not timely because
the fatal injury had already occurred.

* {@fournier} --- The defence of abandonment was put to the jury and
failed in a case in which the accused had arranged for the killing for
hire of her husband, and then left a voicemail less than two hours
before the offence saying only "cancel."

◊ The new element of the defence shifts the focus away from the
party’s intention to abandon and her communication of withdrawal—the
factors at the heart of the accused's moral culpability—and now
requires her to take positive steps to influence the course of future
events, over which she ultimately has little control.

◊ Communicating to the principal that "if you go, then you go
alone"---and in the present case, that "you must not go at
all"---should certainly be legally sufficient for the defence of
abandonment because the abandoning party has severed her connection
with the principal prior to liability crystallizing. To require her to
"do more" is contrary to the purpose of the defence of abandonment,
which identifies circumstances in which an accused can no longer
justifiably be held responsible for the acts of others.

[@manson, p. 88]

◊ The present case is a particularly clear example of circumstances in
which neutralizing steps should not be required. Believing that she
had successfully dissuaded her spouse from completing a murder-suicide
pact, the Appellant not only withdrew her support, but believed she
had prevented the commission of the offence. Given the circumstances
as she understood them, her failure to take further steps cannot be a
basis for imposing criminal liability for first degree murder.

◊ The position that timely and unequivocal communication is sufficient
to raise the defence of abandonment is consistent with English
authorities, which provide that reasonable steps to prevent the
offence, while relevant, are not required.

[@oflaherty, para. 60]
[@otway, para. 32]

◊ Reasonable neutralizing or preventative steps can be evidence to
support the inference that an accused intended to abandon the offence,
and that the communication of withdrawal was unequivocal, but they
must not be requirements in their own right. They are superfluous to
the purposes and principles of the defence, just as would be a
requirement to seek medical attention for someone after striking them
in self-defence: it may be desirable from a policy standpoint, but it
is not relevant to the essence of the defence. A defence should not
have elements added to it for policy reasons or out of a fear that the
defence is too easy to raise if doing so undermines the principles of
criminal liability.

◊ The ease with which a defence may be raised must not be confused
with the ease with which it may succeed. A jury is expected to weigh
the evidence and come to a reasonable finding. Additional requirements
should not be added to a defence out of a fear that a jury might
wrongly acquit an accused on the basis of a weak defence.

◊ The requirements of the defence are already difficult to
satisfy. Communication that is non-existent, equivocal or too late has
provided a consistent, predictable basis on which Canadian courts have
been able to identify meritless claims of abandonment.

[@stuart, p. 674]
[@fournier, para. 22]
[@leslie, paras. 558-561]
[@pk, para. 15]

### The new element of abandonment creates uncertainty in the law and should be left to the jury

Regardless of the form of participation, if there is evidence of an
intention to abandon and timely and unequivocal communication of
withdrawal, the sufficiency of withdrawal is a question for the
jury. The new element added by the majority in the Court below more
accurately identifies an evidentiary component to the question of
whether an offender has abandoned participation. Even the majority
recognized that an accused will not always have to satisfy the new
requirement. Although the majority does not acknowledge it, one such
circumstance might be in the context of a violent spousal
relationship, where to take reasonable steps would put a potential
accused in harm's way.

[@gauthier-scc, para. 51]

◊ As a result, when and how a lack of evidence of reasonable
neutralizing steps will prevent the defence of abandonment from having
an air of reality is ambiguous. The majority indicates that where a
person has aided, it will be difficult for timely and unequivocal
communication, without more, to meet the test. Judging by the
majority’s application of the test to the Appellant, the position
would appear to be that acts of assistance will generally require
positive acts of intervention, and that this can be assessed with
reference to hypothetical steps the accused might have taken, given
the form of her participation.

[@gauthier-scc, paras. 51, 63]

◊ Whether the communication said to constitute withdrawal satisfies
the reasonable neutralization requirement should itself be a question
for the jury. This is particularly true where that communication is a
countermand or an attempt to dissuade---as in the present case---or
where the party has an honest and reasonable belief that she has
prevented the offence, as is the case in other common law
jurisdictions. Recognizing that there are many circumstances in which
communication may satisfy the reasonable neutralization requirement
even for aiders is more consistent with one of the important purposes
of the defence of abandonment: "to compel the principal to reconsider
the objective in time to abandon it."

[@oflaherty, para. 60]
[@croxford, para. 52]
[@white, p. 351, Gibbs J, 361, Jacobs J]
[@duong, para. 203]
[@huynh]
[@manson, p. 101]

◊ The Appellant's case illustrates that the question of whether
communication alone could reasonably have been sufficient cannot be
divorced from the factual circumstances because it is---and should
be---highly contingent on other facts. Making neutralizing steps a
separate element that can be met by timely and unequivocal
communication of withdrawal, but only in certain circumstances, means
that only some accused will face this additional evidentiary
hurdle. This renders the availability of the defence uncertain.

## The majority erred in applying the reformulated defence of abandonment retrospectively to the Appellant

◊ If this Court holds that the defence of abandonment now requires
that an accused take reasonable steps to neutralize previous
assistance or to prevent the commission of the offence, this change
should not be applied retrospectively to the Appellant. Given the
universally accepted understanding of the defence of abandonment at
the time of the Appellant’s offence and trial, it would be
fundamentally unfair to hold her criminally liable for failing to
demonstrate a requirement that was not, at the time, part of the
defence.

[@gauthier-scc, paras. 95-96, Fish J]

◊ In considering whether the trial judge and Court of Appeal erred in
declining to put the defence of abandonment to the jury, it is not
appropriate to reformulate the law in a more stringent way and then
ask, "Was there an air of reality to this new version of the defence?"
Doing so is fundamentally unfair to the Appellant in two ways.

◊ First, it denies the Appellant the defence that should have been
available to her at her first trial. If the trial judge had not
mistakenly held that the defence was unavailable in the context of
s. 21(1)(b), the Appellant would have been able to raise the original
defence of abandonment. The majority should have granted the Appellant
a new trial so that she could raise the defence that was incorrectly
denied her—the defence of abandonment as it had been recognized in
Canada for over 70 years.

◊ Second, applying the air of reality test to the new version of the
defence, at the appeal stage, denies the Appellant a trial on the
defence of abandonment on the basis of a requirement that she never
had an opportunity to address. If, as the majority held, there is no
evidence on the record to establish an air of reality to the new
element of neutralizing steps, this is at least in part because the
Appellant’s testimony was never directed to this requirement at
trial. Even if the new version of the defence is to be applied
retrospectively to the Appellant, it must only be at her new trial.

◊ The retrospective application of criminal law that is detrimental to
an accused is contrary to the values embodied in the _Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms_. Section 11(g) of the _Charter_ protects the
right not to be found guilty on account of any act or omission unless,
at the time of the act or omission, it constituted an offence under
Canadian law. The value expressed in this section must apply to the
situation of judge-made law removing or limiting a defence that
existed at the time of the accused’s act. Limiting a defence is
functionally equivalent to expanding an offence, and could lead to a
person being found guilty on account of an act or omission that would
not have constituted an offence at the time when it was committed. In
the present case, the Appellant's omission of neutralizing steps leads
to criminal liability, which would not necessarily have been the case
prior to the majority's reformulation of the defence.

[@charter, sec. 11(g)]
[@stuart, p. 37]

◊ Furthermore, the rule of law includes a presumption against
retrospective effect, which must apply to all laws in Canada. While
judge-made law may have been excluded from this fundamental principle
in the past, this exclusion was due to the historical view that judges
merely declared existing law rather than created new laws. This view
is almost universally accepted as outmoded and wrong, and is belied by
the majority's significant alteration of the defence of abandonment in
this case. It should make no difference whether a change to a criminal
law is made by Parliament or by the courts if the practical effect is
the same---the retrospective application of criminal law that expands
criminal liability, in violation of the rule of law principle.

[@stuart, p. 9]

◊ The presumption against retrospectivity applies to judge-made law
and to defences. As stated in _R v Bernard_, "[r]espect for the
principle of certainty and the institutional limits imposed upon the
law-making function of the courts _should constrain the Court from
overruling a prior decision where the effect would be to expand
criminal liability_." In _R v Dineley_, the Court found that
eliminating the common law "_Carter_ defence" could not have
retrospective effect: "The fact that new legislation _has an effect on
the content or existence of a defence_ ... is an indication that
substantive rights are affected. I cannot accept the approach
... according to which legislation that _alters the evidentiary
content of a defence_ applies retrospectively."

[@bernard, para. 55 (emphasis added)]
[@dineley, para. 16 (emphasis added)]

◊ In the present case, the majority's reformulation of the defence of
abandonment changed the content of the defence, overruled the
longstanding authority on the defence, and had the effect of expanding
criminal liability. Prior to this change, the Appellant would not have
been found criminally liable for failing to take neutralizing or
preventative steps, as long as she met the other requirements of the
defence. Therefore, the new version of the defence should not apply
retrospectively to the Appellant.

## The majority erred in not finding an air of reality to the defence of abandonment

◊ This section omitted.

## The failure to put the defence of abandonment to the jury is a reversible error

◊ The majority's failure to put the defence to the jury is an error of
law pursuant to section 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Code. The curative
proviso (s. 686(1)(b)(iii)) should not apply in this case because
there is a "reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been
different had the error ... not been made". In other words, had the
defence of abandonment been put to the jury, the Appellant reasonably
could have been acquitted.

[@criminal-code, ss. 686(1)(a)(ii), 686(1)(b)(iii)]
[@cinous, para. 55]
[@khan, para. 28]

## Conclusion

◊ The Appellant has never had the merits of her defence of abandonment
considered by a trier of fact. Instead, she was denied a new trial
through the retrospective application of a newly formulated defence on
which she never had an opportunity to present evidence. The Appellant
respectfully submits that there is an evidentiary foundation for the
defence of abandonment that must be put to a jury.

# Nature of the Order Sought

◊ The Appellant requests that this Honourable Court allow this appeal
and order a new trial for the Appellant.
